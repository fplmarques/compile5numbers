## Justification: Cestode Taxonomy and Statistics

As show above, like other tools available out there, WormBox compute summary statistics from your images. This summary includes measures of central tendencies and dispersion of your data, as well as averages of pseudoreplicated data. All these concepects will be discussed below. If you gathered morphometric data and summarized the information using statistics you have to think what those values mean to you – truelly what can you do with them. Are they simply a description of your data? or Are they sample statistics from which you are trying to estimate parameters of population? These are two fundamentally different approaches in statistics pertaining to descriptive and inferential statitistics – respectively. This dichotomy may, at first glance, be trivial and uninteresting, but for statistical theory they are not! If you put these questions into the context of taxonomic descriptions, and you state:
